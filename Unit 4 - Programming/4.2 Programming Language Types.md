# Object Oriented Programming
With the creation of objects with classes and user-defined types with structs, we can encapsulate our data as attributes inside objects. This allows the amount of data our operations are exposed to to be as simple (small) as possible.

Inheritance allows a class to build on top of the functionality of another class, or create an implementation of its interface.

Polymorphism allows us to override the functionality of these parent classes, creating more variation in inheritance.

Design Patterns allow reusable and extensible patterned relationships between objects to be implemented to allow a more extensible and adaptive program that is easier to maintain, all of which are based on Object Oriented Programming.
