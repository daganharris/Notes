# What is computational thinking?
Computational thinking is a set of soft skills that, when used as a process, help people, especially programmers, solve a problem.
## The four steps
### 1: Decomposition
- This is where a complex problem is broken down into smaller tasks;
- It allows each subtask to have a clear focus and be examined more closely;
- This by effect makes it easier to understand and solve the subtasks and thus the problem as a whole;
- It is done by breaking the problem down, and describing for each subtask the key features of it and their process.
### 2: Abstraction
- Abstraction is the process of simplifying a problem by removing all non-relevant information;
- This is done to ensure when a problem is being solved only necessary information is considered;
- Higher level programming languages abstract away the details of the system (e.g memory management) in order to make advanced programming easier to implement.
- It is done by considering information and deciding if it is necessary.
### 3. Pattern Recognition
- Pattern recognition is where the remaining information of a problem is considered for patterns;
- Discovering patterns can allow us to write reusable code by isolating them in functions to begin with, almost as if we have refactored already;
- This is done by looking at the solution details of a problem and noticing for any repetition or other structures that continually appear.
### 4. Algorithmic Design
- Taking our simplified subtasks that we may have identified patterns in we can apply algorithmic design - the process of implementing an algorithm for solving it;
- This may include identifying variables and constants and inputs/outputs of the problem;
- As algorithms are general steps applied to solve a problem, we must step-by-step implement the solution carefully.
