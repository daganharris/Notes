# Graphs
## Stand Up Maths
Matt Parker from stand up math wanted to use each letter only once to try and make a set of unique words in sequence - a specific variant of many dictionary/vocabulary related problems. His program took 31 days running continuously on his computer to calculate the longest possible combination. 

While more optimized non-brute-force methods may not have been that slow - the fastest combination comes by sorting words into a graph and traversing the graph. This use of graph theory cut the calculation time from 31 days down to 22 minutes. 
That is 5000x faster!
## Packet Routing
The web can be represented as a graph, which is used as a way to solve the problem of packet routing while they are still in transit. Allowing them to take the shortest path between many linked servers speeds up data transfer speeds/.
