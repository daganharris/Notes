3D Graphics are the creation and manipulation of objects on the computer in three dimensions such that they have (width, height and depth/XYZ co-ordinates).
# Geometric theory
There are 3D equivalent of the 2D lines and shapes. Faces are where lines join into a 2d surface and vertices are made where lines join. Polygons are where faces join into a 3D shape.

Considering these foundational concepts, geometric theory refers to the mathem
