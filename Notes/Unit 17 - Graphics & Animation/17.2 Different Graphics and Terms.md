Graphics convey information to their audience. They can promote, educate, inform and entertain.
# Different Mediums
- Logo;
	- A unique and identifiable symbol representing something (a service, organization, business, brand, product, etc..);
- Poster;
	- Give information to the reader and to promote something;
- Floorplan;
	- Provide information about the area better than photographs;
- Packaging;
	- Be eye-catching and inform people of what is in the box.

| Meaning  | One created using points and shapes with relative positions and colors. Because it is relative it can scale infinitely without loss of quality, and having very small quality. The downside is it cannot contain images that look lifelike. | It is a grid of pixels with red, green and blue values. This is translated from a sensor with debayering. It can contain real images of the world, but has limited resolution and will lose quality when scaled. Unless compressed, file size is large for reasonable resolution. |

# Vector
![[../../../Assets/17.2 Purpose of Different Graphics, logo.png]]
https://www.co-operative.coop/media/assets
This vector graphic is designed to easily identify the co-op brand, while representing their humanity and care relative to other brands as the logo is flexible in the way it can be read, showing the brand's wider flexibility. Vector images, which this is, use points, Bezier curves and shapes which are positioned relative to each other instead of to a grid, which makes them infinitely sizeable. 
Thus the use of vector graphics allows the logo to be used on their ads, leaflets, or on product packaging of any size without quality loss. The simple shape and two tone color scheme maximizes contrast. These characteristics allow recognition without distortion or readability when very large or very small. For example, a billboard would need a large logo, but the limitations of a name badge require a small one.
# Legality
- This logo is a registered trademark with the UK Government's Intellectual Property Office. This means it can only be used by people other than the co-op with their permission.

https://www.marketing-beat.co.uk/2025/01/15/co-op-vccp-value-campaign/
This bitmap graphic depicts an ad by the co-op. Its purpose is definitely advertising, and to provide promotion for the membership scheme, by providing information about its financial incentives (i.e. lower prices). It being bitmap allows it to display real life objects captured from a camera, in this case the components of the meal deal. This not only entices people to visit the store for one or more of these items but also compels them to become a member for those incentives.
The fixed size means the image is purpose made for the medium it is displayed in, which in this case is alongside their homepage on their website. The ability to easily compress the size of an image and there not be a perceivable difference in the quality of the image so long as it is displayed at its native resolution or smaller. This is done with this image using lossless compression, as it is encoded in the PNG format.
# Resolution
Resolution in terms of images usually refers to the clarity of the image. It applies to bitmap images only, and is generally measured as the number of pixels. We represent this number as two of its factors, that is, the image's horizontal and vertical sizes.

| Type                  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| DPI (dots per inch)   | DPI refers to the number of dots per inch when the graphic is printed on a page. Higher DPI means a print with higher quality as the dots are a smaller size relative to the whole image. 300 DPI is considered high quality for printing photos.  72 DPI is standard for images displayed on screens. |
| PPI (pixels per inch) | The pixels per inch measure how many pixels are packed into a single inch. Higher PPI means more pixels are in a single inch, resulting in an image that looks better as a single pixel is smaller in relation to the whole image.                                                                     |

Display resolution - This refers to the number of distinct pixels that can be displayed on a screen. Common display resolutions include:
- 640 x 480 (480p/i) - Standard definition (SD);
- 1280 x 720 (720p) - High definition (HD);
- 1920 x 1080 (1080p) - Full HD;
- 2560 x 1440p (1440p/2K);
- 3840 x 2160 (2160/4K) - Ultra HD.
# Software
There is a plethora of software for different graphics applications. Vector based and bitmap based software solutions work differently as they need to manipulate different data graphically.
## Vector Based
- Adobe Illustrator†;
- Inkscape;
- Affinity Designer;
- Corel Draw.
## Bitmap Based
- Adobe Photoshop†;
- GIMP;
- Corel Paint;
- Krita.
*†- Adobe is shit..*
## Graphics Origins
One must be able to describe and talk about, based on the type of graphics, what software was likely used for manipulation of the graphics. Depending on the constituent graphics of a composite, multiple of both types of software may have been used.
# File Formats
Different file formats are used for different purposes, even within the bitmap or vector subtypes.

# Compression
## Lossy
- Gets rid of unnecessary data (e.g. using DCT)
- Cannot restore the original image
- Smaller file size
- Can set quality level in software
## Lossless
- Retains its original quality
- Can restore the original image
- Relatively larger file size
