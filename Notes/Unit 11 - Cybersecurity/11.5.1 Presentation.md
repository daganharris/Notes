*Before I start I have a difficult announcement to make. I know this will, without a doubt deeply, upset all of you, but I am sorry, I must.*

*2 and a half years ago I discovered greatness, and I was immediately hooked. But like so many great partnerships through history, like Diana and Charles, it wasn't to be. And then one of them had the other killed by getting a chauffeur drunk.*

*So with that heartfelt, tender thought in mind, I regret to inform you this, as you may have glimpsed, was made in Google Slides, and not in Figma. As will every presentation I do from now on.*

*Now I am not done with Figma completely. It's still great. Kelly you should totally use it. But its a lot of effort using it to make a presentation that is only going to be seen once.*

*But as you may be able to tell, I do like putting on a show. So, if you'll join me, lets send Figma off to the next life with a round of applause.*

*Goodbye, my friend wipes * non-existent tear.* *

Oh and by the way the notes for this presentation can be found alongside the rest of my notes on my website so don't worry about typing. 

So, now that I've wasted 2 minutes of everyone's time, Attack vectors. 

Now all of these surround the idea of networks, so let's start with general issues that arise around internet connection.

The main one is different types of Man In the Middle Attacks, like ARP spoofing or compromised network equipment. The end result, if through pretending to be the network's router or otherwise, is the ability to intercept and alter network traffic.

This, of course, is bad. While lots if not most data is encrypted in transit these days, any unencrypted data could be read or modified. 

If DNS poisoning is used along with some certificate forgery, then requests to a legitimate site are get content, including websites from a fake provider instead of the real one. 

This could mean users unknowingly type their password into what they hope to be Figma- to what they think is the real site but is in fact a login stealer.

So how can this be fixed? Well using known secure DNS resolvers like Cloudflare is a start - this stops DNS poisoning for the most part. 

Using HSTS helps to avoid spoofing of certificates. Ensuring end-to-end TLS is used and segmenting the network into VLANs will also help to avoid other MITM attack exploits as security is mandated and any unusual traffic can be sealed off.

The other large vulnerability is open ports. A port on a host can accept any network connection so long if there is a service listening on that port - generally this is a set port for a given protocol.

This however, is an attack surface. *Some* protocols or applications may be fine, but even so, if this service is vulnerable for any reason, like if it is even slightly misconfigured, then it is a risk too.
