- Specification;
- Cost;
- Productivity;
- Efficiency;
- Compatibility;
- User needs;
- Security;
- User experience;
- Connectivity.
# Choosing components
- Manufacturer;
	- Affinity to a particular manufacturer;
	- Corporate policy;
- Specification;
	- What hardware meets the needs and supports the required features;
- Warrant/ongoing support;  
	- What is the corporate level of support (SLA, response times etc.)?
- Adherence to standards;
	- Integration with existing components;
- Familiarity;
	- Required training;
	- Staff skills;
- Infrastructure;
	- What does the component has to fit into (e.g. is the building already wired with CAT6?). 
# Performance factors
There are a number of performance factors to consider:
- Available bandwidth and connections methods;
- Load;
	- Is demand likely to be 100%?
- Professional level equipment or SOHO?
- Infrastructure;
	- Limited by existing infrastructure.
