# The Three Types of Organizations

# Public
*Types: Government department, national government, public corporations, quangos*
The public sector is made up or organizations and departments run by the central or local government. Their role is to provide services for the public, such as Douglas City Council. They are financed through the raising of taxes (e.g. income tax). They don't have to make profit but need to be as efficient as possible to provide good value for money.
## Public Corporation
Public corporations are subsidiaries of departments that have agency over certain government services, designed to make money for the government like a corporation would, with a balanced focus on availability, reliability and generation of revenue for the government. However, the corporation does not have to have a positive cash flow. An example would be Bus Vannin.
## Quasi-non-governmental-organization (quango)
Arms-length bodies (ALBs), also called quangos, have agency over government services like public corporations but can make their own decisions without political or governmental influence. Depending on the freedom, the organization may be government funded or not. An example would be Manx Care.
# Private
*Types: Sole trader, partnership, PLC, LTD*
## Sole Trader
A sole trader is the simplest type of business, as the business and its owner are treated as one and the same. However, this comes with unlimited financial and legal liability. The owner is classed as self employed and their profits are taxed as income.
## Partnership
Similar to a sole trader, owned by two or more people.
Each partner has responsibility for the business including unlimited legal and financial liability. Includes finance, legal issues, a share of property and profits. Usually a deed of partnership detailing rights and responsibilities. Can also have 'sleeping partners', people without responsibility in day to day running of business. Many 
## Limited Liability Companies (LLC)
Liability is limited to the value of the shared in the company. The ownership of the company is divided into shares. Anyone who owns shares own part of the business. Shares can be sold privately or publicly. **LLCs are their own legal entities.** 
## Co-operatives
Co-operatives are organizations owned by their employees, designed to be more accountable and ethical than profit-driven business.
# Voluntary Sector
## Not for Profit Organizations
Provide and sell products and services, but are *not* ran to make a profit. All income is spent on running the organization.
Charities for instance, get donations or sell goods to provide the funds to support their chosen area.
