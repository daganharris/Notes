| SMTP | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol | Used by clients to send outgoing messages to servers and between mail servers. | Redefined by RFC 2476 in 1995.                                               |
| POP3 | Post Office Protocol v3       | Older standard for recieving mail from a server.                               | Legacy standard over IP defined in 1985. Files leave server when downloaded. |
| IMAP | Internet Mail Access Protocol | Replacement standard for POP3 for clients recieving.                           | Newer standard where emails are synced, not downloaded and deleted.          |

> [!QUESTION]
> Describe how SMTP, POP3 and IMAP used to transmit data from sender to receiver.

*SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and is used by the sender's email client when transmitting the email to the mail server. The sender's mail server may need to transmit the email to a different mail server - if this is the case it will also be done with SMTP.*

*POP3 stands for Post Office Protocol v3 and is the legacy method of receiving email from a mail server. The receiver's client will download the email, removing it from the server. However, this therefore means the email now cannot be accessed again from a different location.*

*IMAP stands for Internet Mail Access Protocol and is the newer protocol for receiving email from a mail server. The email will sync this email with the receiver's client, with the email staying on the server. This can be accessed from a server.*
