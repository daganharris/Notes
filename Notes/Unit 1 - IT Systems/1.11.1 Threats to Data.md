| Hackers                | Hacking is gaining unauthorized access to a computer system. This does not need to be technically accomplished - guessing passwords is a form of hacking for example.                               | The person's data may be compromised, including their personal finances and their important info.                                                          | Data breaches can leak highly secret information like employee and customer info and trade secrets. Their system could also be victim of sabotage. Can also impact reputation. |
| Phishing               | Emails sent claiming to be from a reputable source with a link that will in some way steal information.                                                                                             | Phishing can put all personal information at risk, including financial information.                                                                        | Can result in large financial losses with the modern business-targeted phishing attacks that target financial institutions.                                                    |
| Pharming               | Malicious code is installed on the victim's machine. This redirects official websites to bogus ones when navigated to, allowing data theft. Fake DNS entries are used to redirect to the fake site. | Entering information on bogus sites will cause data to be stolen by an attacker. This can lead to losing control of financial accounts and identity theft. | While there are also issues of financial losses and trusting identity, there are also the ideas of damage to reputation.                                                       |
| Accidental Damage      | While not malicious, human error like liquid exposure, impact or losing the device can have impacts.                                                                                                | The device or data may need to be replaced and may be lost forever if irreplaceable.                                                                       | Can lead to loss of reputation, intellectual property, operational disruption and loss of revenue/user data.                                                                   |
# Examples
## Malware
WannaCry was a ransomware attack in 2017 that impacted more than 200,000 computers. Ransomware encrypts user data, releasing the decryption key after a ransom is paid.
## Phishing
A single Lithuanian email scam once cost Google $100 million dollars after the phishing attack was successful.
## Pharming
A Brazilian Bank had its site traffic on affected machines redirected to a replica in 2017. Over the course of the next day the login details of these redirected users were captured, leading to an untold amount of financial loss and reputational damage.
## Hackers
SolarWinds' Supply Chain was hacked, and malicious code was introduced into one of their products which was then sold to consumers. 
## Accidental Damage
In 2010 a prototype 4th generation iPhone was left in a bar by the 27-year-old software engineer working on the device.
