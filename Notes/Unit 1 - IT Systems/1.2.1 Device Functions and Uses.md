Digital Devices, being largely multifunctional with lots of application software have many applications, functions and uses.
# Brainstorming
## Productivity Software
- Information access and education;
  - Especially during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic;
  - Web servers allow access to websites;
    - Online encyclopedias (e.g. Wikipedia, Britannica);
    - Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) (e.g. Google Classroom);
    - Learning sites (e.g. Coursera, YouTube, W3Schools);
      - Example: First Aid (link);
  - Cloud servers owned by Educational Institutes and Google allow collaboration and sharing of resources;
  - Printers allow the physical distribution of resources and hand-outs;
  - Organization-owned PCs allow students to complete work;
  - Interactive whiteboards allow educators to teach with interactive presentations and demos.
## Personal Use
- Shopping and online access;
  - Amazon;
  - Other eCommerce-ran businesses;
- Entertainment;
  - Video Games;
  - Online Video;
  - Streaming Services;
- Personal finance;
  - Mobile/online banking;
  - Commercial office software for personal finance;
- Smart home;
  - Learning thermostats;
  - Smart speakers;
  - Connected appliances and lights.
## Communication
- Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Discord;
  - Share content and communicate;
  - There are drawbacks:
    - Privacy concerns;
    - Mental health concerns (e.g. Addiction/Cyberbullying);
- Instant messaging;
  - Free over WiFi;
  - Usually more compatible than SMS;
  - Proprietary however;
- VOIP clients;
  - Alternative to phone calls;
  - Free to use over WiFi;
  - Ability to transmit voice and video conversations.
## Retail
- Electronic Point-of-Sale (EPOS);
  - Uses devices to record sales and payments;
  - Process sales much quicker and more accurately;
    - Self-service systems allow less staff to be paid;
- Barcode readers;
  - Add new items to a sale quicker than a keyboard;
- Optical Mark Readers (OMR);
  - Allows lottery tickets to be read;
- Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR);
  - MICR readers can verify cheques and process/read the chequeâ€™s reference numbers;
- Chip and PIN;
  - These readers allow bank cards to take payments;
- Near Field Communication (NFC);
  - Allows contactless payments using RFID;
- Stock Management;
  - Database management systems that run on servers will be networked with EPOS systems;
  - When products are sold, stock levels change automatically;
    - If stock falls to a certain level, more can be ordered straight away;
    - Because of this, less administrative staff are needed and thus this reduces human error and lowers business overheads;
- Websites/eCommerce;
  - All a business needs is a Web Server instead/alongside a store to allow them to reach a wide (potentially international) customer base;
  - This is also a way of reducing business overheads/increasing revenue;
    - It is far cheaper than opening a physical store;
    - Sales can also occur 24 hours per day, 7 days per week;
- Loyalty Cards;
  - Businesses can use discounts to incentivize people to shop more;
  - They can also collect your data to inform their pricing and promotions;
- Organizational Use;
  - Businesses use PCs with office software suites;
  - This allows them to produce quickly high-quality material for projects;
- Video Conferencing using VOIP;
  - Allows people to take part in meetings from anywhere in the world and allow displaying presentations;
  - This saves time and money as no traveling needs to occur;
    - Especially if the business is multinational;
- Manufacturing and design;
  - Computer Aided Design (CAD) software allows quick and easy design and collaboration of physical products and parts, with client approval being quicker and more frequent;
  - Machinery and automation allows production en masse with high accuracy and very little downtime.

| Allowed me to learn lots about many different subjects and current events with no barriers, and to stay connected and socialize with my friends. On demand entertainment is convenient with lots of choice. Productivity software has allowed me to achieve and work toward goals and do work. | Massive potential to allow mental health issues to spiral and can lead to distraction and addiction, and can lead to social pressures. Exposure to disheartening and/or graphic content is also a risk. |
