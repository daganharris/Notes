> [!WARNING] Security Issues
> Transmitting data over a network has a number of security issues and considerations, depending on the method and type of network.
# Sniffing and Spoofing
## Sniffing
Sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network. This can be used by system administrators to troubleshoot issues, but attackers can use the same tools to capture sensitive information such personal information.
### Available Software
Wireshark is the most often used packet sniffer.

### Legal Issues
They aren't illegal and have legitimate usage as a diagnostic tool. Additionally they are sanctioned under the Investigatory Powers Act as legitimately used tool by law enforcement. However unauthorized access to data is prohibited under the Computer Misuse Act and Data Protection Act.

| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Personal Secured Cellular Network | Unsecured Public Wifi with SSID Broadcasting |

## Spoofing
Spoofing is the process of masquerading a computer for malicious purposes. One example would be to trick other computers on the network into thinking a given system is the router. This allows the system to be fooled into giving access to services meant for another device, causing a **Denial of Service***.
### Available Software
Hping is a common IP spoofing network.

### Legal Issues
Use for pentesting and troubleshooting is perfectly legal, however use to gain unauthorized access to data is against the Computer Misuse Act and Data Protection Act.

| Least Vulnerable                         | Most Vulnerable                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Server connected directly and unsecured. | Server with cache and Firewall |

# Security Prevention Methods
## Firewalls
A firewall is a device that filters traffic going in and out of a computer. Hardware firewalls are physical devices with massive throughput able to physically filter traffic through cabling. Software firewalls block certain connections on the device itself.
### Available Software
Windows Defender Firewall is a common software firewall.

## Encryption
Encrypting data in transit can prevent packets of the data from being vulnerable to packet sniffing. A cipher is used to turn any plaintext data into unreadable ciphertext, only readable by the intended recipient. TLS (and formerly SSL) are ways of encrypting webpages. across a network securely
