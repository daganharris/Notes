# Factors
## User Experience (UX)
**What kind of User experience does the system have?**
- Ease of use;
	- How simple/intuitive is the system to use/perform tasks on?
- Performance;
	- How powerful does the system need to be in terms of hardware?
- Availability;
	- How often is the system being used/is it always on?
- [[1.4 Accessibility Devices|Accessibility]];
	- How available is the device to be used if someone has a disability?
## User Needs
**What does the user want the system to perform using the system?**
- [[1.1 Digital Devices|Hardware;]]
	- Does the task require performant hardware to carry out the task?
- [[1.2.2 Peripheral Devices|Peripherals]];
	- Does the system need an extra I/O device for the situation?
## Implementation
**How will the system perform once actually put into practice?**
- Timescales;
	- New systems take time to be built, tested and finalized for the user - this is called the **delivery** of the system.
- Testing;
	- System will need to be tested before used to ensure it works properly, but some systems will require greater testing if it needs to be secure or reliable;
- Migration;
	- Configuration, files, data and software will have to be migrated to the new system, some of this can be automated if it is a case of moving data from one system to another, but [[1.5.3 Application Software|software]] may have to be rewritten for the new system;
## Specification
**This is an inventory of the components required to build the system.**
- Use cases;
	- The hardware will change based on how the device is being used - tasks requiring concurrency like graphics or tensor operations will need a good graphics card;
## Compatibility
**The current system may have software or hardware constraints the new system must be able to adapt to.**
- [[IT Course Notes/Class Notes/Unit 1 - IT Systems/1.2.2 Peripheral Devices|Peripherals]];
	- The new system must be able to function with the existing I/O devices;
- [[1.5.3 Application Software|Software]];
	- Some software may need to be run on the systems, in which case the new system must be compatible;
## Productivity 
**How efficient is the new system for the end user and their task/s?**
- Speed;
	- Based on hardware, the speed will be a decider of how much work can be done on the system by its users;
- Convenience;
	- Contactless payment, for example, saves a few seconds here and there which will make queues move faster;
## Efficiency
**How effectively can the device perform the tasks with as little wastage of resources?**
- Time;
	- Systems should be able to save the end user time so they can do other things;
- Staff;
	- An [[IT Course Notes/Class Notes/Unit 1 - IT Systems/1.3 Data Processing#Automatic|automated system will require less human input]] which can save money from wages and inaccuracy;
- Energy
	- Systems use power, but energy efficient systems will use less power than other systems, costing less;
## [[1.10.1 Connectivity|Connectivity]]
**What kind of device or network connectivity does the system have?**
- Wireless;
	- Many mobile devices may only be connectable through WiFi;
- Cellular;
	- Some devices may be able to connect through cellular towers;
- Bluetooth;
	- Others may be connectable through Bluetooth;
- Wired;
	- Some devices may only be connectable through a wired protocol - but while this may be faster it may limit compatibility and requires a port;
## Cost
**In many cases this is the ultimate factor and the cost can vary widely.**
- Specificity;
	- The more specific and unique of a situation, the cost will usually be higher;
- Hardware;
	- The better the hardware, the cost will also usually be higher;
## Security
**How safe is the device from security threats, such as hackers and viruses?**
- [[1.11.1 Threats to Data|Susceptibility]];
	- Some devices are more susceptible to issues than others;
- Vigilance;
	- Some other devices are treated with more care anyway due to their sensitive nature;
- Mitigation;
	- It will cost money to ensure all devices are properly [[1.11.2 Data Protection|protected]];
# Examples
## Travelling sales rep
- User Needs - the rep is always on the move so needs a system with some element of portability as to allow the device to be moved around with the rep on the go;
	- Laptop;
- Connectivity - the system may be away from any wired connections, and use of someone else's network is inconvenient, so a cellular connectivity would be helpful;
	- WiFi and Cellular enabled;
- Cost - this is a single sales rep, and thus a high cost system is out of the question as it would be too much for a business;
	- Mid range systems;
## Corner shop
- Cost - a small corner shop's system must be able to make use of as little money as possible in the most performant manner possible as the budget is limited;
	- Budget systems;
	- Older, still performant hardware;
- Efficiency - the system must be able to process customers in an automated manner to improve accuracy and should be fast as to stop a queue from forming;
	- [[IT Course Notes/Class Notes/Unit 1 - IT Systems/1.2.1 Device Functions and Uses|EPOS]] with barcode scanner;
- User Experience - the system must be easy to use, or easy to learn to minimize the amount of training and training time the employees need to save time and money;
	- Easy to use menu based systems;
## Insurance company
- Security - the sensitivity of the data requires the system be secured well as to comply with data protection and avoid breaches;
	- Anti-virus;
	- Firewall;
	- Group policy;
- Compatibility - their existing system may require any new systems to be compatible with the legacy software and hardware, requiring consideration;
	- Compatibility layers/virtualization;
	- Specific hardware;
- Productivity - if many of the staff will be using this system, it must allow all the staff to be productive, otherwise the company is losing money;
	- Fast systems;
	- Easy to use GUI software;
