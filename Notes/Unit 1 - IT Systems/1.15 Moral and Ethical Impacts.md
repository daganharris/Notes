| Environmental      | Most old technology becomes e-waste. 20 to 50 million tonnes of e-waste is thrown out every year. Data centers consume a huge amount of energy, and that will likely be polluting. Production of new tech uses yet more energy, uses harmful chemicals, water and metals.                  |                                                                                                                  |        |
| Unequal Access     | Not everyone has access to information technology and this is increasingly leading to people from poorer backgrounds being disadvantaged. LEDCs have limited access to the internet.

> [!QUESTION] Exam-style Question
> Students in developing countries may have unequal access to information technology compared to students in more developed countries. 
> Shayan runs a charity that supports these students. Unequal access may be due to a lack of communication networks, up-to-date technologies or educational resources.
   Unequal access to information technology can have immediate and long-term impacts on these students. 
   (a) Discuss the immediate and long-term impacts that unequal access to information technology has on students in developing countries. (10) 

The lack of key information technology infrastructure and devices in less economically developed countries (LEDCs) can mean that it is more difficult for students in developing countries to get as good of an education as in a more economically developed country (MEDC). 

This is because the lack of communications infrastructure limits the content that can be accessed. This leads to these students losing out on the advantages of the education-related online services and the wide range of resources they have. In the long run this means they have less technological literacy than someone with an education from a MEDC. This is especially impactful for jobs that require use of IT systems, and reduces their competitiveness in the job market. 

Lack of up-to-date technology can mean that interaction with IT systems do not have the same educational value as they would in an MEDC, since the technology is older it is more limited and thus may not support the use and training in modern application software. This leads to the IT systems knowledge being on what are effectively legacy systems.

A lack of educational resources has the immediate impact of making IT systems harder to learn in the first place. As many devices do not have a built in user manual, students must rely on these educational resources to learn the systems. A lack of these resources greatly increases the difficulty in learning the IT systems., regardless of the state of the systems themselves. 

Additionally, in developing countries the cost of new software applications is much higher because of the limited availability of the technology. This can lead to specific training on certain applications not being possible because of these financial limitations.

In conclusion, the lack of availability and infrastructure of IT resources and devices can heavily impact the quality of education and the difficulty of learning in certain contexts and may have long-term impacts on the types of career opportunities that these students have.
