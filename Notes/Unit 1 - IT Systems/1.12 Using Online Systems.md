|                  | Cloud Storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Cloud Computing                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Description      | Method of storing data that uses (remote) servers, rather than local storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Software that is stored and at least partially computed on remote servers, accessed with a browser.                                                                                                      |
| Personal Use     | Storing personal files, photos and videos online. These can be synced and accessible on any device.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Accessing graphics software, email and home office software on many personal devices.                                                                                                                    |
| Professional Use | Storing off-site backups of data to allow recovery in case of a loss. Also, business files can be accessed while off-site, perhaps with a VPN depending on the setup.                                                                                                                  | Accessing office applications and email without having to install the software on all workstations.                                                                                                      |
| Advantages       | Data can be accessed on a wide variety of devices from any location with internet. Off-site backups are secure from any damage to the site.                                                                                                                                            | Software with a high demand for computation can be ran partially on the server to allow access from any device. Businesses can subscribe/unsubscribe to software according to needs, making it scalable. |
| Disadvantages    | Can make heavy use of bandwidth due to higher demand for internet access. Hackers could access and misuse any data stored in the cloud. Organizations do not have control of the security of their data, it is controlled by the proprietor of the servers which poses a privacy risk. | Computation makes use of the internet and will use bandwidth. Software accessed via a browser will be inaccessible if there is a network outage.                                                         |

# Factors to Consider

|              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security     | While the cloud may be good for reliant off-site backups, this may come at a cost to control and privacy of the data and its security.                                                               |
| Cost         | Some cloud storage services are free of charge to individual users, but may cost for use in enterprise. However, these monthly fees could be less than the infrastructure needed to do this locally. |
| Features     | Sometimes cloud software has fewer features than a local install, however there is a wide range of choices as there is in the wider software community.                                              |
| Ease of Use  | Online services are easier for non technical users for others, especially in terms of installation. Cloud storage systems often sync  data locally, allowing the same interface to be used.          |
| Connectivity | Cloud based storage and software requires an internet connection for access. The options for cloud services may be limited if internet connection or data allowance are not readily available.       |
# Remote Working
Online systems allow people working from home or anywhere outside the office to access the network of the organization they work for. Systems that help this include VPNs which secure connections and can route them through the office network and Remote Desktop which allows access to a work computer over the internet.
## Advantages
- Allows the flexibility of schedule and life when the ability to work from home is provided;
- No need to pay for commuting.
## Disadvantages
- Can remove people from human contact leading to low morale;
- Work/life balance can be broken down.
