> [!INFO] What is a User Interface?
> A **User Interface** (**UI**) is a point of human-computer interaction and communication in an IT System.

There are four types of interface we can talk about:

| Type                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                        | Pros                                                                                                     | Cons                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Graphical User Interface (GUI) | Designed around graphical icons and images.                                                                                                                                        | Easy to use, with no need to learn commands, easy to move files and data around.                         | Uses a lot more processing power and memory than a CLI would use.                                    |
| Command Line Interface (CLI)   | Designed around around a text interface where commands are sent.                                                                                                                   | Powerful yet simple, being quicker than a GUI if the user is experienced, also is more memory efficient. | It is essential to know the various commands in order to use the system.                             |
| Menu Based Interface           | The interface presents a single menu with all the functions laid out. Used in ATMs, [[IT Course Notes/Class Notes/Unit 1 - IT Systems/1.2.1 Device Functions and Uses\|EPOS]] etc. | Very easy to use in comparison to a CLI. Clear cut actions make it very intuitive and easy to use.       | A large amount of sub-menus and inefficient, limited layouts can make it time consuming to navigate. |
| Adapted Interface              | An adaptable, customizable interface.                                                                                                                                              | Overall look and feel can be changed to suit the user and their needs.                                   | Sometimes multi-user systems can have difficulty managing options.                                   |
