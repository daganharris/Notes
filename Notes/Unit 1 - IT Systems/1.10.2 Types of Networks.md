# What is a Network?
A network is where two or more computers are linked together in order to transmit data. These links can be made through wired or wireless means. There are different types of network, usually defined by size, but there are many aspects to a network.
# Different Types of Network

| Network Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Personal Area Network   | Used to connect devices within the range of a single person, which allows us to connect out digital devices together. Connection is usually made using a short range method like Bluetooth or USB.                              |
| Local Area Network      | A network spanning a small area, usually a single building or site. Allows connection of all PCs in a home or business together to share data. Connection is usually made with a slightly longer range method Ethernet or WiFi. |
| Wide Area Network       | A network spanning larger area, like a country or the globe. This uses dedicated network lines rented from an ISP, linking routers on Local Area Networks together. The internet is an example of this.                         |
| Virtual Private Network | A network that is private, but runs across the internet or more generally a public network. This is done by encrypting the data that is being transmitted over the internet.                                                    |

> [!QUESTION]
> James is considering how he should use his home's wireless network and Bluetooth to allow him to connect his PC, smartphone, printer, smartphone. Explain what the differences are in terms of the type of network (PAN, LAN and WAN) and which would suit his requirement.

*Personal Area Network involves connecting devices together using connectivity like USB and Bluetooth over a short range like 5-10 meters. Local Area Network involves connecting devices together across a building or site using Ethernet or WiFi. Wide Area Network involves national or global connections across ISP lines.

*James would be best connecting his smartwatch and smartphone with Bluetooth, forming a PAN as they will both be close to him and are portable and personal. This will facilitate transmission of health data from the smartwatch and notifications from the phone. However, since a PC and printer will likely remain on-site, they can be connected with WiFi forming a LAN. This facilitates allowing the PC to send files to the printer. A WAN is not used specifically for these devices as there is not a massive distance between the devices, but the site may be connected in a WAN to the Internet.*
# Factors Affecting the Choice of Networks

| Factor          | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Implementation  | Timescales, testing, downtime, schedule limitations.   |
| Specification   | Manufacturer, standards, functionality required.       |
| User Experience | Ease of use, performance, availability, accessibility. |
| User Needs      | Speed, reliability, manner of working (fixed/mobile).  |
| Productivity    | Suitability, compliance, adaptability.                 |
| Cost            | Ongoing costs, infrastructure costs.                   |
| Efficiency      | Performance, utilization, room for growth              |
| Compatibility   | Interoperability, customisability.                     |
| Security        | Security features, monitoring features.                |
| Connectivity    | Choice, variety, location.                             |

# Choosing Components
There are some points to consider when choosing a components:
- Manufacturer - is there an affinity to a certain manufacturer?
- Specification - what meets the needs and supports the features needed?
- Support - what warranty and ongoing level of corporate support and what are their response times?
- Standards - what will work with any standards and existing components?
- Familiarity - what do the clients know and understand?
- Infrastructure - what does it need to be installed along side and can that be incorporated or replaced?
# Performance Factors
The performance of the system must be considered in some key ways:
- Load - is the demand likely to be 100% or will there be some tolerances?
- Complexity - will the infrastructure be professional or will it be a small office/home office level?
- Integration - is there any infrastructure that is aging or legacy that should be replaced?
