- Who is the business?

	- Mainly uses Facebook, posts food on their page;
	- Follows baking and bakery related accounts;

> [!INFO]  Relevance
> Therefore we must consider if given content is relevant: 
> 	- Where will this content come from?
> 	- How will images and videos be sourced?
> Sustained online brands must work hard to ensure content is produced and well-received:
> 	- Monitoring content engagement is just as important as posting;
> 	- Who will monitor and respond to comments?
