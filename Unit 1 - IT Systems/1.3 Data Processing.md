# Manual
Involves an individual entering data into a computer. There are multiple ways this can be done:
- Typing with a keyboard;
- Clicking with a mouse;
- Using a touchscreen;
- Talking into a mic.
# Automatic
When data entry is taken away from an individual, like by a sensor interpreting readings. Examples include:
 - OCR, OMR and MICR to read text;
 - Barcode readers getting codes; 
 - Smart readers (temperature sensors inc.) monitoring energy usage;
 - RFID chips used to monitor animals.

| **Human error** - People are mistake prone, such as typos. This causes incorrect or inaccurate results after data processing. Poorly designed forms can worsen this.                           | **Accuracy** - Data is usually more accurate when done automatically as there is no human error. However things like poor handwriting can affect this. |
| **Time consuming** - It takes time for individuals to enter data manually into a computer system, and preform processing. Using double entry to validate can add additional time requirements. | **Time and cost** - Data entry can be completed much quicker as computers process faster and do not require breaks, saving time and thus money.        |
| **Complex data** - Data can be complex and so automated data entry methods may be less accurate or non-existent. Manual entry eliminates this issue.                                           | **Inflexible** - The automatic systems are usually less adaptable. Some systems can handle more complex data but at the cost of accuracy.              |
| **Reduced training** - Staff are likely more familiar with manual data entry methods. This means that staff will not require training to be able to input data.                                | **Learning curve** - To put the infrastructure in place requires operators, which requires staff to be trained with the new systems.                   |
