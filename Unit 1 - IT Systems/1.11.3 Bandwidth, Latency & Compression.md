# Bandwidth
The bandwidth of a network is the amount of data that can be transferred from one computer to another in a given period of time. Measured in Megabits per second; higher is better as more data can be transferred.
# Latency
The latency of a network is a measure of the time it takes for a data packet to transfer over a network. Measured in milliseconds; lower is better as there is less delay in transmission.

Bandwidth is often considered when thinking about network speed, but increasing network bandwidth might not help network performance in general if there is poor latency.
## Ping
Ping is a measure of two way latency, it is the amount of time it takes, in milliseconds, that it takes for a data packet to go from one machine, to another machine and then back again.
# Use Cases 

| Example          | Bandwidth                                                                                                      | Latency                                                                                                                |

| Online Gaming    | Bandwidth is not as important as there is little data being sent, just updates in things like player location. | Latency must be low so the response time on these updates is quickly recieved.                                         |
| Online Streaming | Bandwidth must be high as video data is large and it must all be sent together.                                | Latency is not as important as a small amount of loading before playback is acceptable and future frames are buffered. |
# Compression
Compression uses an algorithm to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data, for the purpose of reducing file size. This means less bandwidth is used to send the file.
## Lossy
Lossy compression removes data in an unrecoverable manner in order to reduce the file size. Can be used on video, audio and images. It is more effective at reducing file size than lossless, but that removed data cannot be restored. Video and audio compression codecs are needed for lossy compression on these files. If they do not have the right codec they cannot access the file. 
## Lossless
Lossless compression removes data in a manner where it can be restored in order to reduce file size. Can also be used on media, but must be used for compressing text and application files. Less effective than lossy compression, but data can be restored - is needed for text et cetera as inaccuracy is unacceptable. Also overcompression can also make the file size increase.
# Codecs
Stands for "Coder-decoder".

| Hardware Codecs use a dedicated physical component that performs the coding and decoding. It is generally faster and more reliable than a Software Codec, but they are expensive and only support certain Codecs and par Software Codecs use a computer program to perform the coding and decoding. It is slower and requires a powerful machine to run properly, however the software is often free or very cheap and can be very flexible in terms of what Codec is used and the parameters that can be set. |                |
