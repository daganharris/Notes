# Types of Data Source

| Type      | Origin                                             | Benefits                                                                                                                                                    | Drawbacks |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Primary   | Original Research, like Questionnaires and Sensors | The scope and subject can be controlled, and will be up-to-date. It can be more reliable.                                                                   |           |
| Secondary | Finding previous research in journals/online.      | The sample size can be much larger, and as a result it can be much cheaper and quicker to get the data. Not necessarily subject to any organizational bias. |           |
# Reliability

> [!WARNING] Ensuring reliability
> Much of the data presented to users on the internet is not reliable. For data to be reliable it should be complete and consistent in collection. Primary data can be better for this as the collection is performed by us and thus can be ensured.  Secondary data however is harder to verify.

# Methods

| Collection Method | Positives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Negatives                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Questionnaire     | Good for gathering info from large groups, and is easy to analyze. There is no bias between respondents as every respondent must answer the same question. They can be completed anonymously.                                                                             | Poorly worded questions can introduce bias or be misinterpreted, leading to inaccuracy. It can be difficult to get in-depth answers/get follow up responses.                                                                       |
| Focus Groups      | Respondents can build on each others answers, allowing for in-depth responses to questions increasing quality. Questions can be articulated and followed up which allows answers to be better drawn out. It allows for a wider array of points-of-view than an interview. | Respondents can influence each others answers due to conformity. All data is qualitative, not quantitative which can be difficult to analyze. Assembling a group of people can be difficult and requires availability of everyone. |
| Interviews        | Very good for detailed responses as every response can be explored in detail. Questions can be articulated and followed up - each respondent has the opportunity to give their honest opinion without conformity.                                                         | Very time consuming to interview compared to other methods, especially if a large sample size is needed. All data is qualitative, not quantitative which can be difficult to analyze.                                              |
