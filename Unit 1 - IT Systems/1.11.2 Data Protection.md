# Legislation and Codes of Practice
Legislation and Codes of Practice require and implore Organizations to comply with certain requirements, especially involving customer data.
## Legislation
The law is an important part in ensuring compliance with Data Protection act.
### Data Protection Act 2018
This is the main UK legislation for the protection of personal data. It protects the privacy of an individual's personal data that is held by others and gives rights to individuals on what data is collected and how their data is used.

This keeps data secure in most cases and greatly reduces the misuse of data. It also allows for individuals to be compensated for if data is misused. However, it does increase business costs as infrastructure needs to be in place to meet requirements. It does limit how much data can be gathered too, which can reduce the effectiveness of data collection as a business practice. The fines for breach of requirements of up to Â£500,000.
### Computer Misuse Act 1990

> [!WARNING] Exam
> This is likely to be discussed in the exam.

This is the act of law that prohibits unauthorized access to computer systems or cause damage to data intentionally and protects legally against attacks on IT Systems. This also covers threats like malware as well as hacking.

It protects (as a deterrent) individuals from attacks on their computer systems. Those who are in breach of this law can be fined any amount and face 10 years in prison. Organizations computer systems are more secure as a result of the deterrent created by the consequences if found guilty. It does require both organizations and individuals to develop policies for security and adhere to such policies.
## Codes of Practice
Professional bodies and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) define codes of practice for how orgs handle, share and protect. They are not legal requirements but are best practices. They aim to:
- Help support compliance with acts of law in a practical sense;
- Ensure data is not mishandled which would have negative impacts;
- Give individuals confidence that a service is compliant.
# Data Protection Techniques

| Technique                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| File Permission            | Prevents unauthorized access to files based on user account. It allows for setting who access files. The types of access that can be controlled are read, edit, modify, delete and executed. There is Read Only, Read/Write and Full Control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Backup/Recovery Procedures | Backing up data allows recovery of files and their earlier versions if the file is corrupted, lost or modified. Full backups are entire images of all data - this takes up a lot of space and is time consuming. Incremental backups only store what has changed since the last backup. Differential backup is a hybrid - it does a full backup every so often and then an incremental backup more frequently.                                                                                                                                       |
| Passwords                  | Using a password is a ubiquitous way to limit access to an account or system. A secure password should likely be more than 8 characters, both upper and lower cases, and numbers and special characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Physical Access Controls   | Limiting physical access to key areas of a building can help to secure an IT System. This can be done with things like Access Cards that can also be used as identification, this can also be done with a Keypad which requires a code to gain entry. Biometric scanners can be used to check for individual unique biometric data to allow entry - for example a fingerprint, iris or facial scan. Physical access system need things like actuators and electronic locks to actually control the access to the areas on doors and other entryways. |
| Digital Certificates       | Public Key Certificates authenticate a user as the owner of a public key. This allows them to make use of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that is used for secure encrypted communications over the internet. An example is a PGP signature. There are several contents to a certificate however one part is used to verify the sender's identify when sending encrypted data to a website.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Protocols                  | Protocols, specifically Security Protocols, are a key part of data protection as they allow for the secure transmission of data between two computers on a network. Compliance with the protocol is ensured and users can be warned if websites do not use SSL/TLS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
