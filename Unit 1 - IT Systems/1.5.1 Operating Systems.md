> An OS is a suite of software that allows a user and application software to interface with the hardware of a computer easily.

# Types of OS

| Type                     | Description                                                                                               | Example |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Real-time                | Allows monitoring of external events and processes data as soon as it enters the system.                  | RTLinux |
| Single-user, Single-task | Allows one person to use one application at a time. Generally considered legacy in consumer devices.      | Palm OS |
| Single-user, Multi-task  | Allows one person to use many applications at a time. Most modern operating systems are in this category. | macOS   |
| Multi-user               | Allows many users to make use of a computer system. This may be done using a mainframe and terminals.     | UNIX    |
# Roles of an OS

| Role              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory Management | Software needs to be loaded into memory and managed. Since the system only has a finite amount of memory, the OS allocates, reallocates and deallocates memory space. The OS also handles paging, which is the use of virtual memory.   |
| Networking        | Networking capability, including LAN and WAN connection is handled by the OS. TCP/IP and other protocols are managed by the OS. Some network utilities can come with OSes too.                                                          |
| Security          | Most operating system come preinstalled with a range of tools to help against the threats that computers are subject to.  Examples would be a built in firewall and anti-virus.                                                         |
| Multitasking      | The operating system is responsible for the concurrent and parallel processing that allows multitasking to be possible. The resources that are managed include processor time, memory, and disk usage.                                  |
| Device Drivers    | The OS interfaces with input and output devices and forms an abstraction of them allowing any application to interface with that device seamlessly. Drivers are the programs that control the device and form part of that abstraction. |
